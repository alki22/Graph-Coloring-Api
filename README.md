# Graph-Coloring-Api
API that implements the greedy graph coloring algorith. 
Takes DIMACS formatted graphs as input and gives a proper colouring for it. 
The API also takes advantage of the greedy algorithm's order property for approaching the minimum needed number of colors for a proper colouring, so it provides many ordering functions such as Welsh-Powell order, natural order and several kinds of color blocks orders.
